<h1>0x1E. C - Search Algorithms</h1>

<p>Search algorithms are a fundamental computer science concept that you should understand as a developer. They work by using a step-by-step method to locate specific data among a collection of data.</p>

<h2>Types of Search Algorithms</h2>
<p>Here, we will touch two important types of search algorithms:

    Linear or Sequential Search
    Binary Search
</p>

<h2>General:</h2>
    What is a search algorithm
    What is a linear search
    What is a binary search
    What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

<p>Fromat:
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
</p>
